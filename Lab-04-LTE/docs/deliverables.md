# Lab 04 Deliverables

> **Canvas submission:** Upload one PDF containing a clear, curated compilation
> of the required results below. Include the relevant calculations, tables,
> plots, screenshots, and brief explanations in a logical order; an additional
> extensive report is not expected. The filenames below are helpful for
> organizing your working files and are not separate Canvas uploads. For binary
> traces or packet captures, include the relevant observations or screenshots
> in the PDF rather than the raw file itself.

## Part 1 – Trace Collection

1. **Simulation trace files**

   * `DlRlcStats.trace` — raw RLC layer trace from `LteHelper`.
   * `DlPdcpStats.trace` — raw PDCP layer trace from `LteHelper`.

2. **PCAP evidence**

   * `server_trace.pcap` — packet capture recorded on the server's side.

---

## Part 2 – Antenna Configurations

1. **Results summary**

   * `antenna_config_comparison.txt` — short description of differences observed in traces for parabolic, cosine, and isotropic antennas.
   * Mention cases where UE is not aligned with directional antennas.

---

## Part 3 – Throughput vs. Data Rate

1. **Simulation results**

   * `throughput_vs_rate.csv` — columns:

     ```
     data_rate_mbps,throughput_bps
     ```

     with at least 3 different application data rates.

2. **Plot**

   * `throughput_vs_rate_plot.png` — plot showing DL throughput vs. application data rate.

---

## Part 4 – Throughput vs. Distance

1. **Simulation results**

   * `throughput_vs_distance.csv` — columns:

     ```
     distance_m,throughput_bps
     ```

     using isotropic antenna and varying UE distance.

2. **Plot**

   * `throughput_vs_distance_plot.png` — plot showing DL throughput vs. distance.

---

## Part 5 – Mobile UE (Factory Vehicle)

1. **Simulation results**

   * `ue_mobile_throughput.csv` — columns:

     ```
     time_s,throughput_bps
     ```

     Collect for at least three UE speeds: 5, 10, 20 m/s. Include all speeds in one file or provide separate files named `ue_mobile_throughput_5mps.csv`, etc.

2. **Plot**

   * `mobile_throughput_plot.png` — throughput vs. time for each UE speed on the same axes. Mark the approximate point where UE distance to eNB reaches minimum.

3. **Analysis**

   * `mobile_analysis.txt` — answers to:
     - How does throughput change as the UE approaches the eNB?
     - At what distance (approximately) does throughput peak?
     - How does UE speed affect throughput variability?

---

## Part 6 – Discussion

1. **Analysis files**

   * `trace_choice.txt` — explain whether `DlRlcStats` or `DlPdcpStats` was used for throughput calculation, and why.
   * `conclusions.txt` — discussion of observed throughput trends and differences across antenna configurations and distances.

---

## Suggested Working File Names

* `DlRlcStats.trace`, `DlPdcpStats.trace`, `server_trace.pcap`
* `antenna_config_comparison.txt`
* `throughput_vs_rate.csv`, `throughput_vs_rate_plot.png`
* `throughput_vs_distance.csv`, `throughput_vs_distance_plot.png`
* `ue_mobile_throughput.csv`, `mobile_throughput_plot.png`, `mobile_analysis.txt`
* `trace_choice.txt`, `conclusions.txt`

---

**CSV data should include headers, and plots should include labeled axes and
legends. Use the suggested filenames to keep your working files organized while
preparing the PDF.**
