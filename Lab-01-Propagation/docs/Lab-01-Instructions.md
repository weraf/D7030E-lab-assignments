# Lab 01: Propagation Models

**Language:** C++  
**ns-3 version:** 3.47

---

## Objectives

By the end of this lab you will be able to:

1. Use three ns-3 propagation‐loss models (Two-Ray, Cost231‐Hata, Friis).
2. Measure application‐level throughput vs. distance in a two‐node WiFi link.
3. Compare simulated path loss to real‐world measurements.
4. Plot and analyze bit‐rate and path‐loss curves.
5. Use the Nakagami fading model to study small-scale fading effects.

## Scenario Context

You are a wireless engineer planning radio coverage in an **industrial facility**.
The scenarios below correspond to three representative environments:

| Environment | Dominant model | Typical application |
|---|---|---|
| Open warehouse floor | Friis (free-space) | AGV coordination, inventory RFID |
| Underground mining tunnel | Two-Ray Ground | Machine telemetry, worker safety |
| Urban/suburban factory perimeter | COST231-Hata | Cellular backhaul, private LTE |
| All environments (fading overlay) | Nakagami | Worst-case link reliability |

Simulate each propagation model and compare how the radio range and throughput
differ across these deployment contexts.

## Part 1: Simulated Propagation Experiments

### Task (C++): Two-Ray Ground Model

![Two-Ray Ground Reflection Model](../../common/images/twoRayGroundPropogationalLoss.png)  
*This visualization shows the power received under the Two-Ray Ground Reflection model, which accounts for both the direct line-of-sight path and the ground-reflected path between a transmitter and a receiver. The formula assumes constructive and destructive interference between the two rays and is especially suitable for long-range scenarios (beyond the crossover distance). NS-3 switches to this model beyond the Friis crossover point, and uses Friis for short distances due to oscillation artifacts at low ranges.*

![Two-Ray Ground Reflection Model](../../common/images/500px-2-Ray_Ground_Reflection.png)  
*A geometric representation of the Two-Ray Ground Reflection model, showing the paths of the direct signal and the ground-reflected signal between transmitter and receiver. Key parameters include the horizontal distance, transmitter height, receiver height, reflection angles, and total path lengths. The figure demonstrates how constructive and destructive interference arises due to phase differences between the direct and reflected rays.*

1. **Define** distance set

   ```
   D = {dᵢ, 7dᵢ/8, 6dᵢ/8, …, dᵢ/8}
   ```
2. **For each** distance `d ∈ D`:

   * Edit `Lab1_Cpp_TwoRay.cc` to place nodes at `(0,0)` and `(d,0)`.
   * Run the simulation, capture UDP throughput.
   * Record bit-rate vs. distance.
3. **Plot** bit-rate (y-axis) vs. distance (x-axis).

**Likely Issues:**

* Mode name typo (`DsssRate5.5Mbps`): see [docs/troubleshooting.md](../../docs/troubleshooting.md#running-simulations).
* Zero throughput if no routing/mobility errors: see [docs/troubleshooting.md](../../docs/troubleshooting.md#running-simulations).

### Task (C++): Cost231-Hata Model
![COST231 Propagation Loss Model](../../common/images/cost231PropogationLoss.png)  
*The COST231-Hata propagation loss model, a widely used empirical formula for predicting path loss in urban and suburban environments. The model extends the original Hata model to frequencies between 1500 and 2000 MHz, making it applicable to GSM and LTE networks. It includes corrections based on base station height, mobile antenna height, distance, frequency, and urban density. The formula supports environment-specific adjustments through correction factors for urban vs rural scenarios.*

Repeat steps 1–6 using `Lab1_Cpp_Cost231.cc` and the Cost231‐Hata model.

---

### Task (C++): Friis Model
![Friis Free-Space Propagation Model: Line-of-Sight Power Decay](../../common/images/friisPropogationLossModel.png)  
  *Friis propagation loss model, which calculates the received signal power under ideal free-space conditions (no obstacles or reflections). It is based on antenna gains, wavelength, and distance between transmitter and receiver. The model is only valid in the far-field region (typically when distance 𝑑>3𝜆/2𝜋), and breaks down at very short distances due to singularities.*

Repeat steps 1–6 using `Lab1_Cpp_Friis.cc` and the Friis model.

---

### Task (C++): Nakagami Fading Model

![Nakagami Fading](../../common/images/friisPropogationLossModel.png)
*Nakagami-m fading is layered on top of Friis large-scale path loss to model
small-scale multipath fading.  The m parameter controls severity:
m=1 gives Rayleigh fading (worst case), m→∞ approaches AWGN (no fading).
This is relevant in industrial environments with reflective metal structures.*

Repeat steps 1–3 using `Lab1_Cpp_Nakagami.cc` and the Nakagami fading model.

Notes:
- The Nakagami model is stochastic.  Run **two seeds** per distance point and
  average the results (same pattern as the other models).
- The m parameters in the starter code are set to m=1 (Rayleigh); you may
  experiment with higher m values and note the effect.

**Likely Issues:**
- Higher variance in throughput vs. other models: use multiple seeds and report
  the average, not a single run.

## Part 2: Real-World Propagation Measurements (**Optional**)

> **Optional extension:** Part 2 is available for additional practical
> experience and is not part of the required lab work. The filenames below are
> suggestions for students who choose to complete it.

> **Recommended**: work with a partner and laptops.  If an industrial site is
> unavailable, a long corridor with metallic fixtures (e.g., a server room
> hallway) is an acceptable substitute — the key is to observe multipath
> effects beyond free-space Friis prediction.

### Task: RSSI & Path Loss Measurement (Industrial or Corridor Environment)

1. **Set up** an ad-hoc Wi-Fi link between two laptops.
2. **Choose** an environment: a warehouse-style space, a corridor with metal
   surfaces, or at minimum a standard corridor.  Note the environment in your
   discussion file.
3. **Measure** RSSI at distances 1 m, 2 m, … until at least 20 m (ping +
   Wireshark or an RSSI tool).
4. **Compute** path loss (dB) = Tx power (dBm) − RSSI (dBm).
5. **Calculate** Friis path loss for the same distances.
6. **Plot** measured vs. Friis path loss on a single graph.
7. **Explain** discrepancies between measured and theoretical curves.

**Likely Issues:**

* Missing RSSI fields in Wireshark: enable Radiotap headers.
* Units confusion (dBm vs. mW): double-check conversions.
